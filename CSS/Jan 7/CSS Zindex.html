        <h2>Position- Static</h2>
        <p id="h1" > HTML elements are positioned static by default.
            Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
            An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to
            the normal flow of the page.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="b2">
        <h2>Position- relative</h2>
        <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
            Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be
            adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the
            element.<span id="g"><br>only one out of top/bottom or left/right will work if height and width both not
                defined.</span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="b3">
        <h2>Position- Fixed</h2>
        <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the
            same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position
            the element.
            A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
        </p>

            <h2>Position- Absolute</h2>
            <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
                positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
                However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and
                moves along with page scrolling.
